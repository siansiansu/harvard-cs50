Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A:
By executing `SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;`

```
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
```
The listener's audio aura prominently features danceability and energy, which, according to the insights provided in the article on Spotify's 2021 Wrapped and Aura Reader by Mystic Michaela, might be indicative of a tendency toward an "orange" aura.


Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A:
1. The audio aura calculation also considers top artists. A listener might have a strong connection to certain artists who produce a wide range of music styles.
2. Musical metrics like energy, valence, and danceability rely on objective features, but people's emotional responses to music are subjective. To improve accuracy, personalized metrics could capture individual musical preferences and emotional reactions.
